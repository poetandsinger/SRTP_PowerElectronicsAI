## [2026-07-10] cleanup | Directory fix + cloned repo removal
- Fixed typo: `channelog/` → `changelog/` (5 wikilinks updated: catalog, _index/ee, 3 source notes)
- Moved `traction_inverter_research_synthesis.md` → `ee/traction-inverter/research-synthesis-2025-2026.md`
- Removed cloned repos: `pe_mas_review/` (201MB), `crewai_review/` (18MB) — source notes already captured
- Updated catalog.md with new research-synthesis entry
- Project root clean: only `srtp_docs/`, `.hermes/`, `.claude/`, `IDEA.md`, `.gitignore`

## [2026-07-10] plan | Rewrote implementation plans based on comprehensive research

## [2026-07-09] research | Multi-agent system synthesis + architecture plan
- Searched local vault first — found 8 existing cs/harness/ notes covering architecture patterns, comparative analysis, and individual harness deep dives. No multi-agent synthesis existed.
- Studied closed-source patterns: Claude Code subagent model (per-agent model+tools, hooks, granular permissions), Codex CLI sandboxing.
- Studied open-source code: smolagents ManagedAgent (task→report contract), LangGraph StateGraph (checkpointed state machines), CrewAI role-based agents with entity memory, AutoGen GroupChat for design review, Hermes delegate_task pattern.
- Created [[cs/multi-agent-synthesis]] — topic note synthesizing 10 design principles from 7 harnesses, with red-team block. Key findings: one-level delegation covers 90% of research workflows (UNVERIFIED — see audit); task→report contract prevents context pollution; per-agent model selection may reduce costs (magnitude unknown without benchmarking); checkpointing is valuable for simulation fault tolerance.
- Created [[implementation/plans/multi-agent-architecture]] — concrete implementation plan: 5 agent roles (Orchestrator, Literature, MATLAB, Reviewer, Writer), LangGraph state machine with 6 nodes and conditional iteration, Hermes Agent operational infrastructure, 4-phase implementation roadmap.
- Updated catalog.md, _index/cs.md.
- Files created: cs/multi-agent-synthesis.md, implementation/plans/multi-agent-architecture.md

## [2026-07-10] ingest | 2026-07-09 audit — multi-agent synthesis self-audit

- **HIGH — Fabricated cost claim fixed:** "60% cost reduction" in log was unsupported. Replaced with honest uncertainty.
- **HIGH — Paper gap filled:** Captured MasRouter (arXiv:2502.11133v1) and EvoAgent (NAACL 2025, arXiv:2406.14228v3) as source notes. Both address orchestrator routing but are limited to coding benchmarks — domain gap to simulation routing remains.
- **HIGH — Red-team blocks added:** 3 ee/ notes (what-is-a-traction-inverter, circuit-topologies, components) now have adversarial review blocks. 5 remain uncovered.
- **MEDIUM — smolagents code claim corrected:** Synthesis described a `ManagedAgent` class that doesn't exist. Actual implementation is prompt-level (`ManagedAgentPromptTemplate`), not code-level. Updated synthesis note with correction.
- **Source notes created:** sources/cs/masrouter-2025-llm-routing.md, sources/cs/evoagent-2025-evolutionary-delegation.md
- **Audit report:** _lint/multi-agent-audit-2026-07-09.md
- **Unverified remaining:** LangGraph checkpointing overhead, Claude Code subagent docs, MATLAB Engine API reliability.
- **NEW: CrewAI memory now verified** — cloned repo, read `unified_memory.py` (complete rewrite). No more short/long/entity memory. Unified LLM-analyzed memory with scoped hierarchy, composite scoring, adaptive recall. Updated crewai.md and synthesis note.
- Files modified: cs/multi-agent-synthesis.md, cs/harness/crewai.md
- Files modified: cs/multi-agent-synthesis.md, ee/traction-inverter/what-is-a-traction-inverter.md, ee/traction-inverter/circuit-topologies.md, ee/traction-inverter/components.md, log.md, catalog.md

## [2026-07-09] ingest | PE-MAS — working power electronics multi-agent system
- Discovered PE-MAS (github.com/spongelovesorange/PE-MAS) — a LangGraph StateGraph-based multi-agent system for flyback converter design with 10 agent nodes, domain guardrails, skills system, lifelong memory, PLECS integration, and evidence-gated release.
- Cloned locally (173 files, 518KB), reviewed architecture: graph.py (171 lines), state.py (180 lines, 30+ typed fields), knowledge_guardrails.py (301 lines), skills_manager.py (259 lines), validator.py (928 lines), lifelong_memory.py (939 lines).
- **Validates 12 of our architectural proposals** with real working code — LangGraph, checkpointing, HITL, guardrails, skills, evidence gates, structured state, reasoning traces.
- **6 patterns PE-MAS has that we didn't plan:** plan-then-execute, best-effort tracking, correction review, iteration playbooks, dual knowledge retrieval (keyword+vector hybrid RAG), evidence grading.
- **3 things we have that PE-MAS lacks:** provider-agnostic, MATLAB/Simulink (not PLECS), Hermes infrastructure (cron, gateway, cross-session memory).
- Captured as source note: sources/cs/pe-mas-flyback-mas.md. Updated synthesis and catalog.
